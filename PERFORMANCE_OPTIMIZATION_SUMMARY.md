# üöÄ Performance Optimization Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all the performance optimizations implemented to fix the low FPS issues on the website.

## üéØ Key Performance Issues Identified

3. **Heavy Re-renders**: Components re-rendering unnecessarily
4. **Custom Cursor Performance**: Continuous mouse tracking and DOM manipulation
5. **Background Music Overhead**: Audio processing on all devices
6. **Real-time Subscriptions**: Multiple WebSocket connections
7. **Large Bundle Size**: Too many components loaded at once
